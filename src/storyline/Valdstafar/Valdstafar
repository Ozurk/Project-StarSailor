You've arrived at Valdstafar!

The gas giant Valdstafar is the richest celestial body in all the skies, both literally and metaphorically. The precious natural gases of its atmosphere funded the
foundation of sky city currently dominating half of the planet's face, but the city itself was built as a temple to excess. The local government is composed of a loose
alliance between mining guilds and criminal enterprises, and they've invested their infrastructure into a realm of debauchery. Pleasure palaces and casinos mar the streets,
some the size of whole city districts. Endless signs and holograms barrage the senses, each promising physical gratification, more instantaneous than the last. A maze of
transporter chutes and catwalks jut through the smog, ferrying the populace from wonder to wonder. Your ship breaks through the aquamarine cloud cover, and is immediately
bathed in the neon lights of the city below. Valdstafar City stretches before you, an overbloated barge afloat a ephemeral sea of green vapours. This place was built to 
dazzle and distract, to corrupt and contain its victims within a cage of inescapable debt. The city will show you everything you could ever want, and will do its damnest to 
obscure all that you need.
