You've arrived at Acropolis!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The marbled dunes of Acropolis dwell at the heart of the formidable Brimstone Belt, a lustrous pearl adrift a minefield
of combustible rock. The Sun Seared Navigator deftly directs you through the seismic detritus and the danger is quickly
behind you. Polished pearl deserts below reflect ash baked atmosphere above as you descend onto dusty dunes. The White
Wastes are an endless sandy sea pocked with pale basalt volcanoes and geothermal wellsprings. Lava floes carve their way
through the salted plains, crafting molten rivers and cooked glass shores. The realm beneath Acropolis' surface is rich
with resources. Deposits of precious minerals are plentiful, and improbable oases spring up across the wastes from the
generous water basins deep below. Vegetation not choked out by volcanic ash flourishes in the fertile soil with exotic
hardiness. Forests of spiked succulents scatter the sands, and a lone Obsidian Citadel mars the bright face of a distant
erupting mountain range. The titular capital of the planet, the surface of the city Acropolis perches on a warm plateau.
You dock alongside the Eyrie, a craggy nest where the hunters roost their Rocs, giant birds of prey native to the Waste.
Masterfully chiseled marble tunnels lead into the subterranean sanctuary beyond.
