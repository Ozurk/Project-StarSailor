A Overclocked Lightwelder runs red hot, steam whistling off its rotund metallic frame. It's voice box drones out to you,
"I have overseen this forge for millennia and time has taken its toll on me. These rusty joints once shined with a coat
of star paint, but has since peeled off over the many centuries in this immense heat, and without its protective
properties, I fear for my imminent dissolution. Here. I fear the last can of starpaint was used up decades ago, should
 you find some. I will bestow upon you a pallet of hardlight. This will surely be invaluable in the exploration of
more distant skies."
