You've arrived at the Twilight Isles!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You sail on a sea of midnight blue, a blanket of stars twinkling from its hue. The shining liquid below
reflects the constellations above, and the refracted points give you the impression of standing inside a geode. Slowly,
an archipelago blooms upon the blurred horizon. A bale of cosmic turtles nest here, their gargantuan frames of
shimmering jade coasting along gently. Oceans of starlight pool upon the top of their shells, pouring endlessly over the
edges and into the void below. An alien atmosphere draws the remnants back up into storm clouds, and showers of
glimmering starfall refill the silver seas. Autumnal tropics dapple each chrome surface, warm isles of palm trees
coloured crimson and maple rustle gently in the cool, misty breeze. Natives harvest rich starfruit and other exotic
flora in the rich soil and skim across the starlight from shell to shell in jade canoes reminiscent of the turtles
themselves. The largest turtle of this nest sits at its queenly core, and you bring your ship in to the rustic skyport
dwelling on its back. Brilliant pagodas of carved ironwood and oily stained glass dominate the skyline. The port's
platforms float among them, and you join the myriad of vessels thronging the rooftops.
